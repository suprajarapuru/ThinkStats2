Exercise 2.1:
Page 25: 2-1 (Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to summarize what you learned about whether first babies arrive late…)


Answer:
Firstly going through the histogram (Fig 2-5: Histogram of pregnancy lengths), we can only arrive at the conclusion that the majority of the pregnancies happen to be 39 weeks. We cannot say whether first or other babies arrive late.If we look at the mean pregnancy length between first and other babies. That too is almost the same, a difference of 13 hours, which comes to 0.2%. So nothing can be concluded from this fact too.Another way prescribed in the book is through Cohen’s d variable calculation. That value also comes out to be too small to conclude anything.
